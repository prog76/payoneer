# Refund policy
Here’s the refund policy I follow:

    - The entire amount will be refunded if I can’t manage schedules after accepting a project.
    - I accept payment by milestones, there will be no refund for milestones completed (as agreed by the client).
    - If I can not finish the project within deadline, the client can ask for refund of the current milestone and they can end the contract
